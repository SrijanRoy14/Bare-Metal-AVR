## Bare-Metal-AVR

- Created simple Arduino HAL-like APIs for digitalRead, digitalWrite, and pinMode, and applied them to blink the onboard LED.
- Tweaked the makefile to include the `src` folder in the path.
- Also learned in detail about creating custom header files, HAL APIs, and including them in applications.
- AVR-GCC tool chain for linux is used, use the make flash command to run the file.
